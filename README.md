# VSpoetry

Small package that automate adding the Poetry virtual environment path to VScode settings.json so VScode can find the right environment for the project.

Install it before creating a virtual environment so you don't have to reinstall it. Except if you change your main python version, if you use `pyenv` for example.

`pip install vspoetry`
